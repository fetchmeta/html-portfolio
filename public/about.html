<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm super excited to be learning how to code. Right now, I'm getting the hang
  of HTML and having a blast figuring things out! Next up, I'm diving into CSS
  and then tackling Java. It’s been a fun and challenging journey so far, and I
  can’t wait to see where it takes me.
</p>

<p>
  My goal is to become an intermediate coder in both Java and Python, so I can
  build online platforms for the entrepreneurial ideas I have. It's thrilling to
  think about the possibilities that lie ahead as I develop my skills. Exciting
  times for this aspiring coder!

  Thanks for stopping by and checking out my About Me page! As a token of
  appreciation for your interest, here's a fun fact: I have a Belgian Malinois
  named Bleu. I decided to spell it "Bleu" instead of "Blue" after learning how
  common "Blue" is as a dog name, and I wanted to stand out—just a little!
